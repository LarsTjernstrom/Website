            <h1>Make the apps work for you</h1>
            <p>As simple as it is to develop Starcounter apps, it is much more fun to do it in a good company. Your apps are integratable out-of-the box. Become the vendor of a best-of-breed app or build your complex system out of simple parts made by others.</p>
            <p>We believe in a future where myriad vendors create the collective app economy. Build and sell an app in a domain that you know the best. Build your complex system out of simple parts that are already available.</p>
